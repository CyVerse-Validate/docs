 Updating the docs
===================

Updating the documentation is easy and should be done as users
discover useful tips and tricks along their own workflows. All
documentation is stored on github in plain-text at
https://github.com/CyVerse-Validate/docs.

Accessing the source
====================

Make a working copy of the documentation from
https://github.com/CyVerse-Validate/docs/

**from the terminal**

from your working directory, download the project from github::

     git clone https://github.com/cyverse-validate/docs.git

After a change has been made to the master repository, `readthedocs
<https://readthedocs.org>`_ automatically builds fresh html
documentation hosted on their servers.

**from the desktop**

browse to https://github.com/CyVerse-Validate/validate-doc

click "Clone or Download" at the right. You can use the github desktop
app or work with the compressed folder using the text editor of your
choice. For comprehensive edits you may wish to use `Atom
<https://atom.io>`_ with the language-sphinx package enabled with the
documentation directory selected as your project folder.

Forking & Committing Changes
============================

Follow the standard git commit process to request changes. For a full
introduction see:

- https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
- https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/
- http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

In short, you'll want to create a fork of the repository from the
terminal or the github project's website. The repository includes
restructured text source files, html, and a make command for
previewing the html on your own machine. Once you've finished with
your proposed changes, add & commit the changes to your fork & open a
pull request to the master branch at cyverse-validate/docs.


Updating table of contents
--------------------------

One unique feature of Sphinx is its ability to cross reference between
pages and maintain a hierarchy of separate documents, making it
preferable to other markdown languages for documenting extensible
projects. These features are handled using unique directives
documented <here>. The most important of these will be “toctree” where
you define your table of contents. To add an additional page, you’d
update index.rst to include the new document, and create a new text
document "filename.rst”. The formatting is fairly self-explanatory;
see the existing index for an example.

Building Sphinx html on your own machine
-----------------------------------------

To preview the documentation, you'll need to compile html files using the command::

  make html

from the project root. Fix any warnings or errors that appear
(generally caused by the existence of unlinked files or absence of
linked ones), and view the html output in your default browser with::

  open _build/html/index.html

On a windows machine, run make.bat instead.
