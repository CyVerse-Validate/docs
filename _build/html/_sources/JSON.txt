Submitting jobs on Stampede
****************************

You have two alternatives for running your tools on Stampede. The Agave API allows you to :ref:`jobs` as outlined in our quickstart guide.

For further reference see:

You can also use Stampede's parametric launcher to distribute your work across multiple nodes. For large jobs, this has tangible speed benefits & is in general a more secure & efficient computing practice.
