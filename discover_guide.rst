Uploading data to the Discovery Environment
============================================


For a comprehensive guide please see `here <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Uploading+and+Importing+Data+Items+Within+the+DE>`_


For this tutorial we will use the publicly-available BayesR example data, which we can upload using the "importing from URL" method.

1. In the Discovery Environment, click the Data button on the left-hand side. Here we'll create a new folder to import the data to.

2. With the Data window open, click on your user name and then file -> new folder. Any name works-- here we'll use "BayesRData"

3. With "BayesRData" open, click upload -> import from URL.

4. In another tab, browse to https://github.com/syntheke/bayesR/tree/master/example/. BayesR requires .BED, .BIM, and . FAM files to run, so you'll need to upload simdata.bed, simdata.fam, and simdata.bim to your DE folder.

5. To upload the data, open the file on github and then right-click on "Raw" to copy the link address.
